# AGENTS.md template

Render a short operational file. Each instruction must describe a verified
repository fact, a measurable outcome, an irreversible-action boundary, or a
specific trap that automation cannot express.

## How to render

1. Discover the repository's real commands and run them before naming them.
2. Select one canonical completion command. If none exists, list the verified
   command set and mark the missing aggregate check.
3. Record repository-specific invariants with file or command evidence.
4. Record generated-file ownership, cache invalidation rules, packaging traps,
   and deployment checks only when local evidence proves them.
5. Include destructive-action and secret boundaries. Keep other workflow and
   style preferences out of the rendered file unless a checker enforces them.
6. Merge verified user-authored constraints. Remove stale generated guidance
   only with user approval.
7. Preview material changes before writing.
8. Keep the rendered file short. Put detailed architecture in `.pi/project.md`
   and link to it.

Do not copy generic coding doctrine, research philosophy, prose rules, planning
rituals, or examples from another repository. Do not invent commands.

# Agent Rules

## Golden rule: check when done

```sh
[verified check command]
```

[State exactly what the command runs, what a green result proves, and whether a
build or restart is required.]

## Repository facts

- [What this repository ships and who uses it.]
- [Runtime, language, and package manager facts proven by manifests or config.]
- [Where the durable architecture record lives.]

Evidence: [paths or command output]

## Safety boundaries

- Never delete a file without express written permission.
- Require explicit confirmation before irreversible commands. Quote the command
  and list the affected files, history, infrastructure, or data.
- Never expose, invent, or commit credentials.
- Preserve unrelated working-tree changes and scope staging by path.
- [Add a project-specific production or data boundary only when verified.]

## Repository invariants

- [A dependency, compatibility, generation, security, or packaging rule that a
  checker enforces.]
- [A stable runtime or ownership boundary with its check.]

Evidence: [validator, test, workflow, manifest, or config]

## Operational traps

- [Cache invalidation trigger and exact version key.]
- [Generated source and regeneration command.]
- [Packaging, publication, migration, or deployment behavior that differs from
  local development.]

Omit this section when no verified trap exists.

## Product map

- `[path]`: [responsibility]
- `[path]`: [responsibility]

Keep this map compact. Link to `.pi/project.md` for architecture details.

## Conventions

Include only conventions with a mechanical check or an external protocol, such
as a commit-message gate, exact budget assertion, or required PR check.

- [Convention]: [checker or protocol]

Omit this section when no enforced convention exists.

## Verification evidence

A completion claim requires the exit code and inspected output from the golden
check. If CI or deployment exists, state the exact watch or live verification
command.
