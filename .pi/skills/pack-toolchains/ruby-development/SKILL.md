# Ruby Development

## Use when

Writing or reviewing Ruby or Rails apps, gems, or scripts.

## Do not use when

Non-Ruby backends; `python-development` or `go-development` covers those.

## Key rules

- Follow Rails conventions; deviate with a stated reason.
- Active Record: use scopes and eager loading to avoid N+1.
- Strong Parameters for all mass assignment; never trust params.
- Background jobs with Sidekiq; keep jobs idempotent and small.
- RSpec for tests; describe behavior, not methods.
- Manage gems with Bundler; pin versions for release.
- rubocop in CI; keep the default style unless the team decides otherwise.
- Migrations are the schema truth; roll back and forward cleanly.

## Red flags

Mass assignment; N+1 queries; logic in models that belongs in services; jobs without idempotency; skipped tests.
