# Browser Testing with DevTools

## Overview

Browser testing proves what users actually experience. Use runtime evidence instead of assuming UI code works from static inspection.

## When to Use

- Building, debugging, or reviewing anything that runs in a browser.
- Validating forms, navigation, responsive layout, accessibility-visible state, or screenshots.
- Investigating console errors, network failures, hydration issues, or performance regressions.
- Reproducing bugs that only appear in a real browser runtime.

## When NOT to Use

- Pure backend or CLI-only changes.
- Unit-level logic that is faster and clearer to test without a browser.

## Tool Routing

| Need | Use |
| --- | --- |
| Cross-browser automation, screenshots, repeatable flows | `playwright` |
| Live Chrome inspection, console/network/runtime state | `chrome-devtools` |
| Bot-protected docs or static page extraction | plain `fetch` or `curl` |
| UI implementation guidance | `frontend-design` |

## Process

1. Define the user-visible behavior to prove.
2. Start the app or identify the target URL.
3. Choose the lightest browser tool that can produce evidence.
4. Capture initial state: page URL, screenshot or DOM snapshot, console/network baseline if relevant.
5. Exercise the user flow with stable selectors or accessible labels.
6. Capture final evidence: screenshot, DOM state, response status, console output, or trace.
7. If a bug appears, hand off to `debugging-and-error-recovery` with reproduction steps.
8. Record exact commands/tool actions and observed result.

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Rebuttal |
| --- | --- |
| "The component compiles, so the browser is fine." | Runtime integration, CSS, hydration, and network behavior fail outside compilation. |
| "A screenshot is enough." | Screenshots miss console errors, failed requests, and inaccessible states. |
| "Manual clicking is faster." | Repeatable scripted flows create evidence and prevent regression. |
| "The test is flaky, just wait longer." | Use condition-based waiting and prove the actual state changed. |

## Red Flags

- No browser evidence for UI behavior changes.
- Ignored console errors or failed network requests.
- Arbitrary sleeps instead of waiting for conditions.
- Screenshots captured before animations/data loading settle.
- Selectors coupled to fragile layout instead of accessible names or stable IDs.

## Verification

Before declaring browser work complete, provide:

- URL or local command used.
- Browser tool used and why.
- Screenshots, traces, console/network output, or test result.
- Any untested browsers/devices and residual risk.
